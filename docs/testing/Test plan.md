- Functional appropriateness.

 <br>2. Usability </br>
 - Operability. 
- User error protection. 
- User interface aesthetics.
- Accessibility.</br>
 # <a name = "3">3. Risk Issues </a></br>
- Storage of mobile phone is almost full (not enough space to store application data);
- Unsupported version of Android system.
